-----------

An Arduino-based implementation of a digital setting circles for a
telescope mounted on an ALT/AZ mount like a Dobsonian.  The program
uses hardware interrupts to be able to capture encoder events without
loss.  The sketch implements the "Dave Ek" serial protocol and has been
tested on common Arduino AVR based boards
